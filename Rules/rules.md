## Abstract

*	*The abstract is a* **4** *sentence summary of the conclusions of your paper* [**Kent Beck**](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~migod/research/beckOOPSLA.html):
	1.	State the problem.
	2.	Say why it is an interesting problem.
	3.	What does the proposed solution achieves.
	4.	State the relevance of your solution.
*	*Do not put math, special symbols or citations in the abstract* [**Michael Shell**](http://www.michaelshell.org/).
