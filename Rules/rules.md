# Rules for writing papers (draft)

## Basic

These rules are based on **Simon Peyton Jones'** [presentation](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/writing-a-paper-slides.pdf)

## Abstract

*	*The abstract is a* **4** *sentence summary of the conclusions of your paper* [**Kent Beck**](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~migod/research/beckOOPSLA.html):
	1.	State the problem.
	2.	Say why it is an interesting problem.
	3.	What does the proposed solution achieves.
	4.	State the relevance of your solution.
*	*Do not put math, special symbols or citations in the abstract* [**Michael Shell**](http://www.michaelshell.org/).

## Citing

*	*Do not use brackets as nouns, they are just pointers. It is ok to use them when listing, but not when referring exactly to them [**John Owens**](http://web.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/commonerrors.html)
*	*Et al. is only used when citing the work of three or more authors and it is not in italics.
